    <h1>Energy Dataset</h1>
    <p>The dataset I chose to research is about different energy sources; how these fuel sources are produced, consumed, and their related expenditures</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Energy is used in many different sectors, primarily for electricity, residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation purposes. There are many different types of energy sources that we use such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, petroleum, and renewables.</p>
    
    <h2>A Brief History of Energy</h2>
    <p>The industrial revolution brought about huge coal usage as a means of an energy source. New energy sources would be introduced in the 20th century, such as oil, gas, and hydropower. The dataset is shows energy usage based on the year which is helpful in assessing the ways energy usage has changed.</p>

   <h2>Energy on a National and International Scale</h2>
   <p>Texes, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming account for the highest percent of energy supply in the US. Fossil fuels including petroleum, natural gas, and coal are the USâ€™s primary source of energy, nearly 90 percent of the energy in the US is made from these fuels. Countries such as China, the US, Russia, and Saudi Arabia produce the most energy on a global scale.</p>

<h2>Background about Data</h2>
<p>This data is significant because it gives us an idea of the array of fuel sources we use in a variety of sectors. Regulated data is protected by different laws enacted nationally and internationally. In addition, I learned about public and restricted (private) data. 
Public data is data that anyone has access to; people are able to freely use and distribute the data. 
Restricted data, however, is not available for public use or viewing. Usually this data is confidential and viewership is limited to only certain people.
Metric join type, attribute join types, evaluation order, and subtotals are ways that data can be calculated.</p>
